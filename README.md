1)How to run the program (commands and any other important information):
To run the Python code, execute the following command:python forum_app.py 
After running the command, open the browser and navigate to the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000". The server is running on the default port 5000. If you wish to change the port number, include the following line in the forum_app.py file:app.run(port=8080).

The maximum time limit mentioned was 10 hours, and I utilized the entire allotted time.

3)Short description of what you have done :
For the development of the forum application, I utilized the Python Flask framework for the backend and HTML for the frontend. The project structure includes the following folders and files: Main Folder: forum Subfolders: template and forum_app.py Template Files: index.html, post.html, new_post.html The basic forum application allows users to create new posts and submit comments. Users can create an unlimited number of posts, view existing posts, and add comments to them. Flask handles both GET and POST methods. The application is structured using templates for rendering HTML.
